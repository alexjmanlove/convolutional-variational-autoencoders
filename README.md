This is a collection of projects using both `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow` to implement convolutional neural networks for classification and regression as well as convolutional variational autoencoders for generative image modelling.

## Project 1

**Chapter 1** firstly demonstrates the use of a simple convolutional neural network for supervised tasks: gender classification, ethnicity classification, and age regression. Secondly, we use variational autoencoders to generate novel images.

This image is a previews how changing the hyperparameter values of latent dimension size and $\beta$ regularisation coefficient affect reconstruction quality.

This is an interpolation matrix sampled purely from the learned latent space. None of these folks are real!

## Project 2

**Chapter 2** explores the use of labelled inputs and normalising flows to improve the flexibility and fidelity of the VAE reconstructions.
