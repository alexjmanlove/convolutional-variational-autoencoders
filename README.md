# Deep Generative Modelling with Convolutional Variational Autoencoders

In this project we apply convolutional neural networks in variational autoencoder models to perform unsupervised reconstruction, damage restoration and interpolation of human face images.

## Reproducibility

The .ipynb file is organised into two chapters which loosely follow along with the PDF report. I recommend reading the full report first, then viewing the cell outputs in the notebook, before you try to run the code yourself.     

*N.B.: This project involved training three convolutional neural networks and four variational autoencoders. These models were trained on GPU and collectively took over an hour of compute time.*
