# Convolutional Variational Autoencoders

This is a collection of projects using both `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow` to implement convolutional variational autoencoders for generative image modelling.

Part 1 firstly demonstrates the use of a simple convolutional neural network for supervised tasks: gender classification, ethnicity classification, and age regression. Secondly, we use variational autoencoders to generate novel images.

Part 2 explores the use of conditional and normalising flows to improve the flexibility and fidelity of the VAE reconstructions.
