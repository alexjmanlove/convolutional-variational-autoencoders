This is a collection of projects using both `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow` to implement convolutional neural networks for classification and regression as well as convolutional variational autoencoders for generative image modelling.

**Chapter 1** firstly demonstrates the use of a simple convolutional neural network for supervised tasks: gender classification, ethnicity classification, and age regression. Secondly, we use variational autoencoders to generate novel images.

**Chapter 2** explores the use of conditional and normalising flows to improve the flexibility and fidelity of the VAE reconstructions.
